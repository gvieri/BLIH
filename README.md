BLIH (Bigdata Localized Info Harvester)

This project is aimed to collect a lot of data. It is divided in three parts:
- user front-end 
- admin front-end
- backend

The user front-end is based on web app/pages and the language is javascript. 
The admin front end is based on a php web site with authentication and tigh security 
The backend is based on php scripts and mysql. 

Mysql can be really useful when you have to make a functional demo in few hour. 
The code is written KISS (keep it simple stupid). So it is quite easy to modify to user another database. 


The application's database is described in database directory. 
The application pages uses some existent frameworks.
